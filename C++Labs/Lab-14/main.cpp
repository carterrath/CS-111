//Create a struct called car that has the following data members
//(variables):
//- Color //color of the car
//- Model //model name of the car
//- Year //year the car was made
//- isElectric //whether the car is electric (true) or not (false)
//- topSpeed //top speed of the car, can be a decimal
//Use an appropriate date type for each variable in the struct.
//In main, create two instances of your car struct and have the user enter information for each, then print out the information for both cars to the console window.
//HINT: You must instantiate (create) an instance of a struct (like declaring a variable) before you can use the date members (variables) inside it.
//HINT: Each instance of a struct has itâ€™s own variables.
//HINT: Remember the dot operator to access the variables inside a struct.
