//Modify lab 14 to add a function called PrintCar to print out the information about a car struct. This function should take a single car struct as a parameter (passed by value) and have a return type of void.
//Modify main to call this function to print the information about the two cars instead of doing so directly (total of two calls to the function in main).
//For this lab you MUST place the PrintCar function below the main function â€“ this will require a prototype for the PrintCar function.
