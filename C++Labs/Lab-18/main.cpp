//Modify Lab 17 to be a non-counter-based loop. In this scenario assume that there are an unknown number of scores being entered. 
//The only way to exit the loop is when the user enters -99. 
//Assume that this professor gives out negative scores except for -99 because thatâ€™s their least favorite number for assignments. 
//So they are willing to give out -100 or less. 
//Instead of looking for the highest score, the program looks for the lowest score. However, instead of having most of the code in the while loop, create a function called calculate that receives a score, total, and lowest as parameters. In this function you should update total and lowest accordingly.
//Hint: If you are updating two of your parameters and you need those changes for the next iteration in the loop, what do you use? Pass by Value? Or Pass by Reference?
//Sample output:
//Enter number or -1 to quit: 5
//Enter number or -1 to quit: 5
//Enter number or -1 to quit: -5
//Enter number or -1 to quit: 4
//Enter number or -1 to quit: 5
//Enter number or -1 to quit: -99
//The total score is 14
//The lowest score is -5
//The average is 2.8
